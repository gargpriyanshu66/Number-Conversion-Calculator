# Number-Conversion-Calculator

In This Reprosectory I made a Number System Calculator which allows users to convert numbers seamlessly between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations. This feature is incredibly handy for programmers, students, and anyone working with different number bases using C++. 

In this I use some conversion type fuction and a user define function like Binary to Decimal Conversion, Binary to Octal, etc.

all this function are kept under a loop which allows repeatation of this header function which is easy to use and not need to run program again and again just follow the secquence.

After that I use User defined function in which i decleared How to calculate this specific set of function well defined with the help of comment at every instance of program.
